# C++ Assignments

## Building with the GCC compiler
Install gcc using your package manager e.g `sudo dnf install gcc` or `brew install gcc` if you are on macos.

## How to compile
open up a terminal and cd into a project folder, e.g `cd stack/`.
execute `gcc main.cpp -o program -std=c++11`
finally run the executable with `./program`.
